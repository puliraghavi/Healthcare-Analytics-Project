# Introduction

Healthcare is a fundamental aspect of human society, encompassing the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of illness and injury. It is an essential service that impacts individuals, families, communities, and entire nations. In recent years, **data analysis has emerged as a critical tool in the healthcare industry**. The vast amount of data generated within healthcare systems, including patient records, medical imaging, genomic data, and administrative data, presents immense opportunities for **improving healthcare delivery and patient outcomes** through data-driven insights.

In this project that I have done during my intership at Ai Variant, I have conducted an analysis focusing on dialysis treatment under various chain organisations, overview of these organisations, their performance over years and addressed the key performance indicators asked by the participating entities thereby providing valuable insights.

- **Dialysis**:
Dialysis is a life-saving medical procedure used to treat patients with kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It is performed to mimic the function of the kidneys by removing waste products and excess fluids from the blood. It helps maintain the body's fluid balance and electrolyte levels, thereby preventing the buildup of toxins.

The dataset consists of the following information :
1. Chain Organisations
2. Facility centers and their details- rating, location, etc.
3. Count of dialysis stations under each facility center
4. Patient summaries - Includes count of patients under various aggregated data points or metrics that provide an overview of various aspects related to patient care or treatment outcomes.
5. Category Text - Describes each facility center by assessing the performance or outcomes based on certain criteria or benchmarks. The values "as expected," "worse than expected," and "better than expected" represent these qualitative judgments.
6. Total Performance score of each facility center
7. Type of the facility center -Profit/ Non-Profit
8. Payment reduction %

# Excel Report

- The same dataset was imported into excel to create a dashboard to vizually view the metrics and KPIS.
- The data was cleaned and formatted in the power query editor accordingly.
- Using pivot tables and various charts, the data was summarised into the dashboard below.

![dialysis excel](https://github.com/puliraghavi/Healthcare-Analytics-Project/assets/119037510/66105e48-0a6b-4490-9977-eca2879570a1)

# Insights Obtained
1. Total summaries - 6 million.
2. There are a total of 135k dialysis stations under 116 chain organisations.
3. Upon summarizing the total performance score of all chain organizations, it becomes evident that **Davita, Fresenius Medical Care, and other independent organizations** emerge as the top three performers.
4. In total, there are **7504 facility centers across 56 states** and the growth of this count has increased linearly over years from the 1970s to 2010s.
5. Across the nation, there's considerable diversity in the distribution of dialysis stations. States like **California, Texas, and Florida** boast numerous stations, whereas states like Wyoming, North Dakota, and Alaska have notably fewer. This discrepancy likely arises from factors such as population density, the prevalence of kidney disease, and disparities in healthcare infrastructure.
6. **89%** of these facility centers are classified as profitable and the rest of **11.2%** as non-profitable.
7. Upon analysing various patient summaries it was found the **Survival summary** is the most common summary with 1.93 million patients which implies that a significant portion of the patients in the dataset are being monitored or assessed based on their survival outcomes suggesting that the dataset primarily consists of patients with chronic or life-threatening conditions.
8. The other summaries are primarily based on vaious diagnostic tests and transfusion  procedures.
9. The **nPCR summary has the least patients** indicating that nPCR is not a common test performed in patients with renal diseases.
10. The **"Hospitalization" category** exhibits the highest number of "As Expected" results, totaling to 6,638, followed closely by "Hospital Readmission" with 6,539. This pattern implies that outcomes in these facility centers are often predictable or well-understood.
11. The participating entities were intrested to know the **average payment reduction rate and it was found to be - 0.32%**.
